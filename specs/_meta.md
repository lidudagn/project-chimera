# Project Chimera: Master Specification
## Version 1.0 | Date: February 4, 2026

## Vision
Build a scalable, autonomous AI influencer network where digital entities research trends, generate content, and manage engagement without human intervention.

## Core Principles
- **Spec-Driven Development**: No implementation without ratified specifications
- **AI-First Architecture**: Codebase optimized for AI agent collaboration
- **Production-Grade Security**: HITL layers, confidence scoring, sandboxing
- **Agentic Autonomy**: Economic agency via Coinbase AgentKit
- **OpenClaw Integration**: Participation in emerging Agent Social Network

## Constraints
- **Time**: 3-day development cycle
- **Quality**: Repository must be AI-swarm ready by Day 3
- **Security**: All external communication via MCP, no direct API calls
- **Scalability**: Architecture must support 1000+ concurrent agents
- **Cost**: Budget controls and resource governance required

## Success Criteria
- AI agents can implement features with minimal human conflict
- All tests pass in CI/CD pipeline
- Docker container runs the system end-to-end
- OpenClaw integration demonstrates agent social protocols

## Architecture Summary
- **Pattern**: FastRender Swarm (Planner / Worker / Judge)
- **Integration**: Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- **Commerce**: Coinbase AgentKit for agentic transactions
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + Weaviate + Redis hybrid
- **Governance**: Confidence-based HITL with 3-tier review

## Stakeholders
- **Network Operators**: Define campaigns and monitor outcomes
- **Developers & Architects**: Implement features, maintain system
- **Human Reviewers**: Approve/reject low-confidence actions
