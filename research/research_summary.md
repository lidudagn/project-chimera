# Project Chimera Research Summary

## Key Insights

### a16z: Trillion Dollar AI Code Stack
- Agentic workflows are replacing simple prompts.
- Specifications are now the source of truth.
- AI-focused tools are emerging; humans are secondary.

### OpenClaw & Agent Social Network
- AI agents communicate directly (A2A protocols).
- Skills are modular instruction packages.
- Security is critical in multi-agent ecosystems.

### MoltBook: Social Media for Bots
- Focus on generality: plan, execute, distribute in one system.
- Skills are reusable and shareable.
- Social media patterns mirror training datasets.

### Project Chimera SRS
- Fractal orchestration: humans → managers → worker swarms.
- Converges MCP + FastRender Swarm + Agentic Commerce.
- HITL layers and confidence scoring for production safety.

## How Chimera fits OpenClaw
- Professional implementation of experimental OpenClaw agents.
- Brings structured social protocols, security, and economic operations.
- Bridges human-agent and agent-agent networks.
